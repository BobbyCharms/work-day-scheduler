# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

This challenge required the addition of dayjs() to identify the date and time and use that information to populate information and formatting on the page. The page is dynamic due to JS logic comparing the current hour against the hours displayed. Additionally, we had to use local storage to save text we input into the notes section of the divs so that it was displayed again on refresh of the screen.
